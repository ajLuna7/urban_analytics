## Practice Homework Problems for Class

These files are solely practice problems from our PLAN 672 class. These are mostly incomplete rough drafts and are posted to this repository to save them so that I may improve upon them in the future. I plan to return to these practice problem sets after the semester to build upon methods, improve visualizations, and modify the coding style.
