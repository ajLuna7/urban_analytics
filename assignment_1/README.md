## Assignment 1: Urban Analytics

This project focuses on the tree census data in New York city from 2005. The primary objective of this study is to gain insights from data visualizations using numeric and spatial data. 

We rely on a blog from IQuantNY visualizing tree census data and exploring correlations between median income and tree density (defined by number of trees normalized by total length of streets per neighborhood tabuation area and then standaridized). 

HTML output is the final report.
